## Intro-to-Deep-Learning

The Lab 1 contains three notebooks. Details of each of the notebooks are given below - 

- **Multilayer-Perceptron-Pytorch.ipynb:** In this notebook, we'll see how to implement a simple multilayer neural network to classify digit images. After going through this notebook, you will be able to build an complex MLP network with your choice of loss functions and optimizers. 

- **Convolutional-Neural-Network-Pytorch.ipynb:** In this notebook, we'll implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for digit classification. We'll be using the MNIST dataset as used in the previous assignment.

- **Transfer-Learning-Pytorch.ipynb:** In this notebook, we'll see how to use pretrained weights to finetune your model on your dataset.
